The best way to learn using DynaML's many features is to practice on some data science case studies. The [```dynaml-examples```]({{site.baseurl}}/api_docs/dynaml-examples/index.html#package) module contains a number of model training and testing experiments which are intended to serve as instructive material for getting comfortable with the DynaML API.

The example programs cover a number of categories.

* Regression
* Classification
* System Identification
