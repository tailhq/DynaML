DynaML aims to make a versatile and powerful data analysis and machine learning toolkit available as a shell and runtime environment. As is the case with any tool, relevant background and knowledge is crucial in order to yield its power. This post is intended to be a starting point for online resources which are relevant to DynaML.

## Machine Learning

[Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) refers to the ability to make predictions and decisions from data. It is a field that has evolved from the study of [pattern recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition) and [computational learning theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_learning_theory) in artificial intelligence.

Machine Learning theory and applications lie at the intersection of a number of concepts in the domains of Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science. It is no surprise that machine learning is a rich and deep domain with much intellectual and practical rewards to offer to the persistent and observant student.

The following is a non-exhaustive list of educational resources for learning ML.

## Programming Environment: Scala

[Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org) is the implementation language for DynaML, it is a hybrid language which gives the user the ability to leverage functional and object oriented programming styles. Scala code compiles to Java [_byte code_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode) giving Scala complete interoperability with Java, i.e. you can use Java libraries and classes in Scala code.

The [_Java Virtual Machine_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine) which executes _byte code_ is the run time for the complete Java ecosystem. This enables Scala, Java, Groovy and Clojure programs to run on a common platform, which is a boon for Machine Learning applications as we can leverage all the libraries in the Java ecosystem.

Learning Scala can be a significant investment as the language has a large number of features which require varying levels of skill and practice to master. Some resources for learning Scala are given below.
